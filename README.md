# Cajas de Software

The "Cajas de software" game consists of implementing the idea of the "Wordle" game to guess phrases.
Before starting the game, the administrator must save in the system a number of phrases that will be played each round. These phrases are assigned to each team randomly. Once they have been registered, the game can begin.
The phrases are separated by words, which the players must find one by one to successfully complete the proposed phrase.

If one of the words that the team is trying to find is wrong and exceeds the number of attempts allowed, the team will no longer have the opportunity to find the phrase and will have to wait for the next turn. On the other hand, if the team completes the sentence correctly, a point will be assigned. The team that gets the most points will be the winner.

The game is developed in Python using the "pygame" library.
